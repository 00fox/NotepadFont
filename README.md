It comes with two different versions, between the two, only a size ratio.
- NotepadFont is 2MB and contains 10k characters, easily integrated into a portable program.
- NotepadFont_full is 22MB and contains 40K characters, intended to be installed on the system

Both are seen for the same on a system, so you can replace one with the other without having to uninstall it first.
